I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Arlington, where <a href="https://crystal.uta.edu/~mislam/">Dr. Mohammad Atiqul Islam serves as my doctoral advisor. My research centers around high-performance computing, cybersecurity, machine learning, resource autoscaling, and microservices. 

Before enrolling in the Ph.D. program, I had over 12 years of professional experience, holding critical positions like Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at <a href="https://www.bracbank.com/en/">BRAC Bank PLC and IT auditor and IT security expert for several Bangladesh Government projects (<a href="https://www.cirt.gov.bd/">BGD e-GOV CIRT) funded by the <a href="https://crystal.uta.edu/~mislam/">World Bank. I also bring extensive cybersecurity, risk management, and IT auditing expertise from my work with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/">IBM Bangladesh and <a href="https://kpmg.com/bd/en/home.html/">KPMG Bangladesh, one of the Big Four accounting firms. 

In 2011, I earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (<a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/">BUET). Later, I pursued a Master’s in Information Systems Security from Bangladesh University of Professionals (<a href="https://bup.edu.bd/">BUP) in 2018, where I graduated with a perfect CGPA and was awarded the Presidential gold medal. Additionally, I completed a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Dhaka (<a href="https:/www.du.ac.bd/">DU) . I commenced my Ph.D. journey in the Fall of 2023.
