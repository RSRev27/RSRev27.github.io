This is Zahidur Talukder, Ph.D. candidate from departement of CSE at the University of Texas at Arlington. My Ph.D. supervisor is 
<a href="https://crystal.uta.edu/~mislam/">Dr. Mohammad Atiqul Islam</a>. I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Bangladesh in 2018. Then I started my MBA, at Institute of Bussiness Administration (IBA) from university of Dhaka. I started my Ph.D. from Fall 2019.

My research is focused on the theoretical, empirical, and security aspects of algorithms and machine learning. I have been working
on the efficient data and client handling of federated learning. I have developed self-regulating clients who can handle data-level
errors and new aggregation techniques for servers in federated learning. I am highly passionate about applications involved with
machine learning and algorithms.
