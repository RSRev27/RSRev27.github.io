<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse/">The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)</a>, where <a href="https://crystal.uta.edu/~mislam/">Dr. Mohammad Atiqul Islam</a> serves as my doctoral advisor. My research focuses on high-performance computing, cybersecurity, machine learning, resource autoscaling, and microservices.</p>

<p>Before starting my Ph.D., I accrued over 12 years of professional experience in Bangladesh in numerous critical roles including Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at <a href="https://www.bracbank.com/en/">BRAC Bank PLC</a> and IT auditor and security expert for several Bangladesh Government projects (<a href="https://www.cirt.gov.bd/">BGD e-GOV CIRT</a>) funded by the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>. Additionally, I gained significant expertise in cybersecurity, risk management, and IT auditing through my work with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/">IBM Bangladesh</a> and <a href="https://kpmg.com/bd/en/home.html/">KPMG Bangladesh</a>, one of the Big Four accounting firms.</p>

<p>In 2011, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</a>. Later, I pursued a Masterâ€™s in Information Systems Security from <a href="https://bup.edu.bd/academics/academic_details/464">Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP)</a> in 2018, where I graduated with a perfect CGPA and received the Presidential gold medal. Additionally, I completed an MBA from the <a href="https://www.fbs-du.com/mis.php">University of Dhaka (DU)</a> majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS). I began my Ph.D. journey in the Fall of 2023.</p>
